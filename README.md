# PrivateRouter TGWireGuard Docker Build

This is a pretty simple system where you just run

```
docker-compose up
```

and the rest of the magic happens for you!

When it is done you will have the file in the work folder.

# NOTE

Change tgwireguard/Makefile to have the new version on each new build!
